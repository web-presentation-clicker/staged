## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take security seriously, as anyone should.

If you find a vulnerability, please go to [the security tab](https://github.com/web-presentation-clicker/staged/security) and click the big green "report a vulnerability" button, then fill out the form.

This should go without saying, but please practice responsible disclosure.
